# Fine_Tuning_Stanford_Cars_Classification

We are fine-tuning a few vision models (effnetb0 & GoogleNet) on the StanfordCars dataset to classify cars. We then deploy our top-performing model as a Gradio app to Hugging Face Spaces. 

- Dataset = StanfordCars (https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/generated/torchvision.datasets.StanfordCars.html#torchvision.datasets.StanfordCars)
